# Facility Location Optimization Project

This repository contains the codebase developed during my thesis work at ABW, focusing on facility location optimization, particularly in the context of healthcare facilities.

## Contents

### Data

- **data/**:
  - `example_dataset.xlsx`: Excel file containing a small example dataset.
  - `ermera_dataset/`: Folder containing both supplied and processed (formatted) datasets for Ermera.

### Models

- **models/**:
  - **dynamic_models/**:
    - `naive_multistep.py`: Implementation of the naive facility location model that iteratively selects new locations without considering future periods.
    - `naive_ordered.py`: Implementation of the ordered facility location model that prioritizes locations based on predefined order.
    - `pareto.py`: Module for calculating the Pareto curve, which represents the trade-offs between coverage and other metrics.
    - `single_step.py`: Implementation of the single-step facility location model that optimizes coverage independently for each period.
    - `two_step_constrained.py`: Implementation of the two-step facility location model that optimizes coverage across two periods with constraints.
    - `visualizer.py`: Module containing functions to visualize solutions generated by different facility location models.

### Template Notebooks

- **template_notebooks/**:
  - `Basic_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook providing an example of the basic facility location model as a starting point for the project.

### Utils

- **utils/**:
  - `compare_curves.py`: Module with functions to visualize and compare the percentage differences in optimality performance between different facility location models.
  - `create_data.py`: Module to generate synthetic datasets in the same format as the processed real-world data for testing facility location models.
  - `ermera_data_process.py`: Script used to process the supplied Ermera dataset, preparing it for use in facility location optimization models.
  - `solution_time.py`: Script for benchmarking and comparing computational times among different facility location models.

### Root Folder

- `dynamic_models_control.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to control and demonstrate the functionality of the various scripts in the `dynamic_models` directory. It includes examples of how to use each of the functions implemented in the models.

## Overview

This repository hosts the codebase used to implement and evaluate various facility location optimization models. The models range from simple naive and ordered approaches to more complex single-step and two-step models with constraints. These models were tested on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing their performance in terms of optimality and computational efficiency.
